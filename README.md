- To run the program, you can download the folder from github. In Visual Studio, open that folder and run the file named entropy.cpp.
- If zipped folder in the submission is used, Use the folder directly in Visual Studio.

- The user is expected to enter a password that they want to check the entropy of. 
- If the user enters nothing, it is going to promot user again to type the password.
- If the user entered a password with entrop less than or equal to 30, the program will show error saying to try again for a stronger password. 
- If the user entered password has more than 30 entropy, you get the total entropy of the password.
