- To run the program, you can find a file in Source Files called entropy.cpp. In Visual Studio, open that file and run it.

- The user is expected to enter a password that they want to check the entrop of. 
- If the user enters nothing, it is going to promot user again to type the password.
- If the user entered a password with entrop lessthan or equal to 30, the program will show error saying to try again for a stronger password. 
- If the user entered password has more than 30 entropy, you get the total entropy of the password.
